Digital Oracle Deck App for iOS, designed using Godot Engine

theRealReal Oracle Deck designed by @rainbow__harmony (instagram) or Rainbow Harmony on Youtube. Digitized version will provide several features currently
not seen used in digital oracle decks, including REAL random number generation (not pseudo) for shuffling and drawing, as well as the ability to add personal notes to both the card descriptions, spread guides, and the deck guide itself. There are many more planned features once mvp is launched that are intended to increase ease of use for personalization, sharing readings with clients or friends, and just plain awesome things that physical oracle decks can't do but help make this digital deck feel more intuitive to use and more responsive.

Just uploaded all current files as of October 15th 2021. Project was initially started in 2020, took a 6 month break in 2021 to attempt the project in xcode before realizing it would be advantageous to leave options open for android development, and so I came back to finish the project in Godot. Luckily working in xcode paid off as I understand much much more about the export process and api than I did before.

I will begin posting demo videos and screenshots once the color palette has been settled on, the icons have been designed, and the UI is a bit more polished. Looks like I could be about 1-2 months out from that stage, much of that depends on if there are godot-breaking features from iOS 15.

Once mvp is launched for iOS I will port to Android as soon as I am able, I will have to learn as I go just as I am now.
