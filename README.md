Digital Oracle Deck App for iOS, designed using Godot Engine

Currently doing reorganizing and redesigning before finishing the last few sections. What's left to do? Quite a bit, but what's done is also quite  a bit. Will begin posting screenshots and describing components once the color palette has been settled on, icons designed, and UI is a bit more polished. Looks like about 1-2 months out from that stage, but who's to say timelines can be counted on in programming? Much depends on if there are broken features due to iOS 15 due to camera usage in this app.
