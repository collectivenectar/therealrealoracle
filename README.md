Digital Oracle Deck App for iOS, designed using Godot Engine

theRealReal Oracle Deck is an idea designed and collaboratively created by my partner and I. I helped write and edit many of the cards to include a more balanced perspective on relationships, and I am designing a digital iOS app version of this physical deck for those that are interested.

This 'digitized' version will also provide several features not typically seen in digital oracle deck apps, like an option for TRUE random number generation (not pseudo) for shuffling and drawing, as well as the ability to add personal notes to both the card descriptions, spread guides, and the deck guide itself.

If the project is well received, there may be many more planned features once mvp is launched that are intended to increase ease of use for personalization, sharing readings with clients or friends, and just plain awesome things that physical oracle decks can't do but help make this digital deck feel more intuitive to use and more responsive on a mobile screen.

I will begin posting demo videos and screenshots once the color palette has been settled on, the icons have been designed, and the UI is a bit more polished. 

Update May 2022: After some CS study I'm doing some redesign. Still the same objective, but will likely be a smoother experience.

Since Godot has an good android community, once mvp is launched for iOS I will port to Android as soon as I am able, I will have to learn as I go just as I am now.
